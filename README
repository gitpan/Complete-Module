NAME
    Complete::Module - Complete Perl module names

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.03 of Complete::Module (from Perl
    distribution Complete-Module), released on 2014-06-25.

SYNOPSIS
     use Complete::Module qw(complete_module);
     my $res = complete_module(word => 'Te');
     # -> ['Template', 'Template::', 'Test', 'Test::', 'Text::']

FUNCTIONS
  complete_module(%args) -> any
    Complete Perl module names.

    For each directory in @INC (coderefs are ignored), find Perl modules and
    module prefixes which have "word" as prefix. So for example, given "Te"
    as "word", will return e.g. "[Template, Template::, Term::, Test,
    Test::, Text::]". Given "Text::" will return "[Text::ASCIITable,
    Text::Abbrev, ...]" and so on.

    This function has a bit of overlapping functionality with
    "Module::List", but this function is geared towards shell tab
    completion. Compared to "Module::List", here are some differences: 1)
    list modules where prefix is incomplete; 2) interface slightly
    different; 3) (currently) doesn't do recursing.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ci => *bool*

        Whether to do case-insensitive search.

    *   find_pm => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to find .pm files.

    *   find_pmc => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to find .pmc files.

    *   find_pod => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to find .pod files.

    *   find_prefix => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to find module prefixes.

    *   separator => *str* (default: "::")

        Instead of the default "::", output separator as this character.
        Colon is problematic e.g. in bash when doing tab completion.

    *   word* => *str*

    Return value:
